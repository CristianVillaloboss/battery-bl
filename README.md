Lithium-ion batteries often fail due to microscopic structural defects. Students will build a pipeline to classify battery electrode microstructures into categories (healthy, degraded, cracked, etc.) from microscopy datasets. The project will emphasize dataset preparation, preprocessing with scikit-image, feature extraction...
